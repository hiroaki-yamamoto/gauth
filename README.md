## What this?

When you code web-backend app, you might want an authentication system. For example,
providing login authentication service might be problematic; authenticate the user,
managing sessoin, etc, etc... However, golang doesn't provide the authentication system
in the standard library though it provides HTTP client / server.

Fortunately, the third-party package can provide JWT token generation / decode, so
I wrote this package to provide a minimum authentication function.

## Installation

You can install the package as usual e.g. `dep ensure -add github.com/hiroaki-yamamoto/gauth`.

## How to use

This package has 2 modules:

* **core** provides the core functions like token composer and decoder. In the
    future, this module will provide password hashing function that would
    be easy-to-use.
* **middleware** provides request-wrapping functions, and they are called
    `middleware` in Django (that is a web-framework in Python).

### Using Token Composer and Decoder

I'm trying to write an example. but there's too many code to write here...

Sooooo.... please be patient üëç
